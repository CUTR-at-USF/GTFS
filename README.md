# GTFS

Public transportation schedules and associated geographic information for South-East Queensland.

The data is a snapshot and not planned to be kept up-to-date. The main purpose of this repository is to develop a data package for this dataset.

## Data
Put specific information about the data in a Data section. This can be things like information about the source of the data, the specific structure of the data, missing values etc.

This data is the [General transit feed specification (GTFS) â€” South East Queensland](https://data.qld.gov.au/dataset/general-transit-feed-specification-gtfs-seq) data published by [Transport and Main Roads, Queensland Government](http://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/), licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/) sourced on 07 September 2016.

The data is follows the [GTFS specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/) and some of its [extensions](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/gtfs-extensions) that define a common format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. 

[The data](https://github.com/Stephen-Gates/GTFS/tree/master/SEQ_GTFS) is made up of a number of files. Two data files (shapes.txt and trips.txt) were too large to load into GitHub. They were truncated. They will be adequate to use for testing valid data.

Each data file is defined by a [schema](https://github.com/Stephen-Gates/GTFS/tree/master/schemas). The schemas follow the [json table schema specification](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/json-table-schema/)

These schemas are combined into a datapackage.json file to fully describe the data collection.

## Preparation
Put information on preparing the data in a Preparation section. In particular, any instructions about how to run any preparation and processing scripts to generate the data should go here.
