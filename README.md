# GTFS

Public transportation schedules and associated geographic information for South-East Queensland.

The data is a snapshot and not planned to be kept up-to-date. The main purpose of this repository is to develop a data package and schemas for this dataset.

## Data
This data is the [General transit feed specification (GTFS) â€” South East Queensland](https://data.qld.gov.au/dataset/general-transit-feed-specification-gtfs-seq) data published by [Transport and Main Roads, Queensland Government](http://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/), licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/) sourced on 07 September 2016.

The data follows the [GTFS specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/) and some of its [extensions](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/gtfs-extensions) that define a common format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. The specification allows some files to be optional. It also allows some columns in the files to be optional. This means that the datapackage.json file and schemas may not work for [other GTFS files](https://code.google.com/archive/p/googletransitdatafeed/wikis/PublicFeeds.wiki).

[The data](https://github.com/Stephen-Gates/GTFS/tree/master/data) is made up of a number of files.

Each data file is defined by a [schema](https://github.com/Stephen-Gates/GTFS/tree/master/schemas). The schemas follow the [json table schema specification](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/json-table-schema/)

These schemas are combined into a datapackage.json file to fully describe the data collection. The datapackage.json file follows the [data package specification](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/).

## Preparation
The data was downloaded, unzipped, and then uploaded to GitHub.

Two data files (shapes.txt and trips.txt) were too large to load into GitHub. They were truncated and uploaded. They will be adequate to use for testing valid data.

## Tests
The focus of the tests is to ensure the datapackage and schemas are correct. There are already [GTFS data validation tools](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/guides/tools) to test the data in more powerful ways than json table schemas allow.

Tests are performed using [GoodTables](http://goodtables.okfnlabs.org).

[Successful test results](https://github.com/Stephen-Gates/GTFS/blob/master/results/results.md) data are recorded via a link to the GoodTables results.

- The valid data is tested without and with a schema.
  - use the link to the raw data and schema files as input to GoodTables e.g.
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stephen-Gates/GTFS/master/data/agency.txt
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stephen-Gates/GTFS/master/schemas/agency-schema.json
- The invalid [test data](https://github.com/Stephen-Gates/GTFS/tree/master/tests) is tested with a schema to ensure the schema detects all errors (e.g. [incorrect types](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/json-table-schema/#field-types-and-formats) and violated [constraints](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/json-table-schema/#field-constraints)).

## Schemas
The schemas were created using [DataPackagist](http://datapackagist.okfnlabs.org).

- add some basic information about the data file (name, description, license, etc.)
- upload the data file

A datapackage.json file is created for you with some inferred data types. Download this file.

GoodTables can only use a json table schema for validation ([see goodtables-web #65](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/goodtables-web/issues/65)). You can extract this from the datapackage.json file. It's this bit `{fields: [...]}`. Save this a separate file.

Edit the schema file with a text editor (e.g. [ATOM](https://atom.io), [jsoneditoronline.org](http://www.jsoneditoronline.org)) and add constraints, refine types and formats, etc.
